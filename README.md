# Known issues (regarding dependencies):
- **GithubTrendingAPI:**

The scraper package dependency is not the best, the Repository model properties are inaccessible due to 'internal' protection level but still printable so I slice out the necessary information from it. 
  > In case of production this should be forked and fixed.
  
- **MarkdownView:**

**The latest release lacks support for iOS 16, so I forked it and fixed it. Now the projects rely on a version from my GitHub.**

Also created a pull request for them: https://github.com/keitaoouchi/MarkdownView/pull/103

The MarkdownView webView solution throws some warning on the console, but nothing major.
 > In case of production this should be forked and further fixed.

## Known issues (regarding GitHub API):
On rare occasions, GitHub Repos READ.me download URL is not reliable from the GitHub API. Good chance you never notice that, but worth to mention.
> api/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path} -> response "message": "Not Found"
